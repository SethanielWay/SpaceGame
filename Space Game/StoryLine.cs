+"\n"
+"    Nobody took it seriously. The publicity that had surrounded the event was entirely soaked with mocking humor, blatant sarcasm, and incredibility.\n"
+"For months people all over the states laughed at the ridiculousness of the proposed event, they created memes, shared news articles, and joked about\n"
+"it with their friends. The idea that a single person would truly commit to it, let alone the 2,000,000 people who said they would attend, was so\n"
+"absurd that not even the government was fully prepared for it. The result of this was that when the fated day came the world stopped and stared at\n"
+"their TV's, computers, phones, tablets, or whatever it was that they used to receive their news, because marching along in the chilly desert night at\n"
+"3am on the morning of 20 September, 2019 was a crowd of roughly 1.5 million people. Some people came as a joke, some came to socialize, others came\n"
+"because they wanted to be a part of history, and still others, like myself, came because we believed. We believed the truth, that there really was\n"
+"something to be found underneath the sand of the vast Nevada desert.\n"
+"\n"
+"We were right.\n"
+"\n"
+"    In the hours that followed the beginning of the march, chaos ensued. The military, police, and other government agencies that had taken the event\n"
+"to be nothing more than a joke, had escalated from riot control techniques like barricading to subjugation by any means necessary in what seemed like\n"
+"an instant. One minute everyone had been marching steadily towards the facility, the next people were dropping left and right while running like madmen\n"
+"towards the target. Whether by some stroke of luck, or some great misfortune, I somehow managed to make it past, well, everything, everything from\n"
+"the desert, to the police, to the military blockade, to the very doors that allowed entry into the base. I had slipped by without a single soul\n"
+"taking notice. I had accomplished what was meant to be impossible. I had made it into the worlds most scrutinized source of conspiracy theories.\n"
+"I alone, had found my way into Area 51. I can barely remember what happened next, all at once I had gone from the front door of the facility,\n"
+"opened a countless number of doors, descended an exhausting number of stairs, and trekked through what seemed like miles of hallways. In the end\n"
+"I arrived in what I have come to call \'The Chamber of Truths\'. It was there, in that chamber, that I stumbled upon a lifechanging event. I had \n"
+"walked into a room that seemed to have no end, one side was set up similar to a hangar, with rows upon rows of ships unlike any I had ever seen,\n"
+"on the other side was a series of stereotypical test tubes, with vague humanoid shadows cast upon their opaque glass. I walked up to the first tube\n"
+"and stared into it, mystified, wondering what could possibly be inside. So I did the only logical thing that anyone could do at that moment, I pressed\n"
+"every button, pulled every lever, and flipped every switch I could find, hoping to see, to satisfy my curiosity. Suddenly, the glass on the tube\n"
+"receded and a normal looking human male fell out. The man looked at me, and before he collapsed, said \"They will come for us now, we must escape\".\n"
+"Hurriedly I picked him up and looked around for a means to leave, I quickly came to the realization that I could never find my way back through the\n"
+"maze that led me here. I looked across the room as an insane thought came to me, which, given my current situation was saying something. I was going\n"
+"to steal a ship. Without even thinking through the details of whether or not it was actually possible to do so, I carried him over to the nearest\n"
+"ship, it was singlehandedly the most generic looking space ship I had ever seen, like a futuristic looking jet that had stolen its design from the\n"
+"Galaga ship, minus the rockets. As I approached, a walkway descended from underneath, it seemed to know what it was I wanted to do, because as I \n"
+"walked up the ramp I could feel it lift off the ground and start to spin. By the time I had gotten up to the cockpit area it was facing the wall\n"
+"on the far side of the runway, I placed the man into one of the seats and sat in the other. I had no idea what I was doing but that didn't seem\n"
+"to matter, because the next thing I knew the wall had opened up, revealing a slanted shaft, and the ship had started to speed towards it. The \n"
+"last thing I remember from that day was seeing the traces of daybreak from the top of the shaft, feeling the ship start accelerating at an\n"
+"insane rate, the visible world around me seemingly melting away, and then, nothing.  \n"
+"\n"
+"\n"
+"\n"
+"\n"
+"Nobody took it seriously. \n"
+"\n"
+ "At times, I wish they would have. Maybe then I wouldn't be in this mess.\n";

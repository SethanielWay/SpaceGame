Captains Log
I've quickly come to realize that keeping track of the time
had started driving me insane. So I will no longer attempt to do so.
            
            
            
I wish I would have known. Perhaps I would have been able to live a normal life. I could have had a decent job, married a nice girl, and died
a peaceful death. It seems as if that is but a far off dream now, there is no going back. In escaping with Phillip, the extraterrestrial being
who is most certainly not a normal human male, I have been branded as a supporter of his. Now, normally I would have no problem with this.
Normally. This. Is. Not. A. Normal. Situation. Apparently, Reginald Phillip Zwarkzefald III, is a conspirator who attempted to overthrow the
ENTIRE GALCTIC FEDERATION. In his defense, they do seem to be just as, if not more, corrupt as the government agencies on Earth. However,
they also have what they call The Enforcement Agency. Which is basically a super high tech military that's about 5,000,000,000 soldiers strong.
So yes, I wish I would have known EXACTLY what I was getting into when I decided to join in on the Area 51 raid and freed Phillip. I should
have listened to my mother and just stayed home.\n" +
            
            
It's not all bad though, it's not as if we're flying from planet to planet smuggling illegal goods to make enough money so that we can upgrade
our ship to get to the planet where Phillips militia is currently awaiting his return. . . . . .

Ok. . .  It is all bad.
Someone help me. Please.

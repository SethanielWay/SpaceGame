Captains Log



Are we getting closer to our goal? Is any of this 'progress' that Phillip talks about even real? Is there really an end to this madness?
I remain doubtful of every word he says. Too often I have found myself gaining hope again only to have reality come crashing back down
and breaking me even further. I have given up on the idea of normality and allowed myself to embrace the madness that has surrounded me,
I no longer have any desires to return to a home I can't even remember. I no longer wonder about who my friends and family where, I can't
even remember their names or faces so there's really no point in even trying. I must move forward, I must face my fears, I must allow them
to pass over me and through me, I must persevere so that in the end, only I remain.

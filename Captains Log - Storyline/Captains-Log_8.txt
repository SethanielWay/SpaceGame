Captains Log



    We have one more upgrade to go till we are able to make the journey to the destination. It's
been a long journey and most of the time I honestly didn't think we would make it. I'm not sure
what will happen once we get there or if I'll even continue to assist Phillip with his plans...
I guess I won't know until we get there and I see the true state of everything. I have a lot of
thoughts and emotions to think over and work through...

The next Log I make will be before we embark on what may be our final journey together.

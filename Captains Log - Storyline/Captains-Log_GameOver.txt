Captains Log

    So here we are, stranded above Game.CurrentPlanet.name, out of money, out of fuel, out of goods. We have hit rock bottom.
There is no way for this to get any worse. Phillip keeps talking to himself and checking some screens on the ship. For some 
reason he seems more freaked out than I am, or maybe he's just finally gone insane. I have no idea why but he's been loading
all our weapons as if preparing for a major fight. It makes me want to laugh, the thought of someone coming up here just to
take out an old space fre.... hold on, Phillip is yelling about something.








    I WAS WRONG. It seems that is EXACTLY what is happening. There is a ship launching what I at first thought were rockets
but after closer-than-I-would-like-to-have-been inspection it appears that they are giant harpoon like projectiles. There 
is nothing more we can do to combat this, Phillip has already exhausted our ammunition in an attempt to fight them off. 
We can no longer escape down to the planet as our hull has been compromised. OUR HULL HAS BEEN COMPROMISED. I need to find
the emergency seal or we're going to die. The harpoons are slowly becoming more accurate, or maybe they were never inaccurate
to begin with. What I thought were near misses had actually been disabling all of our utilities that might have provided a means
of escape.

had been watching the leaves fall off the tree in our yard and float away, yearning for the same ability to fly and escape my mundane
life. I can still hear the words I said as I jumped off the roof of our house

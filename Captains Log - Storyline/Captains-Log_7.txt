Captains Log


    I often wonder who I am speaking to when recording these. To? Or is it for? I'm amazed that
I have been able to remember how to speak and write in English after all of this. Or perhaps
I'm not and it's just our built in translators on our suits that cause me to think I'm reading
and writing in English, perhaps I'm writing in some crazy alien language at this point. Wouldn't
that be something, imagine waking up one morning and the translator is broken and now everything
is in some weird alien language that you somehow understand. I'm not entirely sure how I would
handle that, but I do know that it wouldn't be the craziest thing that has happened to me so far.
There was the time with Phillip, the GromFlomites, and the big bag of squanch... but I promised
Phillip to never tell anyone about that and I guess speaking to the computer on board the ship
kinda constitutes telling someone. Sorry for that.

    You wake up, bright lights shining in  your face from all around you, in the background you here
the incessant clicking of keys and buttons, accompanied by a myriad of random whistles, beeps, and 
other noises. You squeeze your eyes shut before slowly trying to open them, as you finally start to
be able to see you hear a voice that you don't recognize, but somehow seems familiar call out to...
you?....
"Aaaaawwwwwww Morrtty, it looks like you glitched the game out. Now you'll never know what
happens to Phillip. Oh well. Now move out of the way so I can have a turn." 

You feel a pair of hands shove you out of the chair you were in as you are finally able to fully see
again. You take in your surroundings, your old memories slowly coming back to you, you slowly start 
to remember that you were only playing a game, that it wasn't your real life, Phillip wasn't real,
none of it was real. As soon as you start to adjust back to reality a stray thought crosses your
mind,




how can you be sure that your current existence is the real one....

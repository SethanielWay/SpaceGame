Captains Log


    I can't remember when my birthday is. I can barely remember my age. The only attachment I still have to who I am as a person is
my name and even that seems foreign to me these days. There are times when I wonder if I really ever lived on Earth. Am I really a 
human? What was my life like? Was I happy? What does happy even feel like? What does it look like? I guarantee it isn't being shot
at by Space Pirates as you attempt to warp to another planet so you can try and survive there long enough to sell some goD DAMN DOORS.
I've given serious thought to just killing Phillip and turning his body in to the Federation so they'll stop pursuing me and I can go 
home. Unfortunately, as I am reminded every time we do trade on Earth, I am Earth's most wanted 'Terrorist'. The real powers in charge
of Area 51 fabricated some horrific events that resulted in the near destruction of the USA and pinned it all on me. So I can never truly
go back. Ever. I can only resign myself to the cruel fate that has been placed upon me. Where there only some way to put everything back
to how it was, I would do it in a heartbeat.

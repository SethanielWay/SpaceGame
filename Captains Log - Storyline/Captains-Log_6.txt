Captains Log




    Perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps there is a reason for hope, we have already gotten so close to the necessary upgrades we need to make it to Phillips planet.
I still don't know it's name. Every time I ask him about it he just tells me it's better the less I know. In fact there really isn't anything that I actually
know about Phillip either, we've been doing this for so long and yet I have no idea who he really is. I guess at this point it doesn't really matter. Whether 
or not I actually agree with his values or what he plans to do is a mute point at this point. I should have thought of it before "agreeing" to help him. Not 
like I had a choice back then. Not like I have a choice now. Regardless of any of that I have long since come to terms with the fact that there's a high
chance that what I am assisting him with isn't exactly the most moral or just cause. I never would have guessed that I would spend my life assisting the
being who was singlehandedly leading the coupe d'Ã©tat against an intergalactic government. I still have a single memory from my childhood that makes me
laugh when I think about it. Watching leaves fall and float away and wishing I could be free like them. If I only knew.

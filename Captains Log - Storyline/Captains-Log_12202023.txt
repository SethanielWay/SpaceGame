4 Days since awakening from Cryosleep

    Nobody took it seriously. The publicity that had surrounded the event was entirely soaked with mocking humor, blatant sarcasm, and incredibility.
For months people all over the states laughed at the ridiculousness of the proposed event, they created memes, shared news articles, and joked about
it with their friends. The idea that a single person would truly commit to it, let alone the 2,000,000 people who said they would attend, was so
absurd that not even the government was fully prepared for it. The result of this was that when the fated day came the world stopped and stared at
their TV's, computers, phones, tablets, or whatever it was that they used to receive their news, because marching along in the chilly desert night at
3am on the morning of 20 September, 2019 was a crowd of roughly 1.5 million people. Some people came as a joke, some came to socialize, others came
because they wanted to be a part of history, and still others, like myself, came because we believed. We believed the truth, that there really was
something to be found underneath the sand of the vast Nevada desert.

We were right.

    In the hours that followed the beginning of the march, chaos ensued. The military, police, and other government agencies that had taken the event
to be nothing more than a joke, had escalated from riot control techniques like barricading to subjugation by any means necessary in what seemed like
an instant. One minute everyone had been marching steadily towards the facility, the next people were dropping left and right while running like madmen
towards the target. Whether by some stroke of luck, or some great misfortune, I somehow managed to make it past, well, everything, everything from
the desert, to the police, to the military blockade, to the very doors that allowed entry into the base. I had slipped by without a single soul
taking notice. I had accomplished what was meant to be impossible. I had made it into the worlds most scrutinized source of conspiracy theories.
I alone, had found my way into Area 51. I can barely remember what happened next, all at once I had gone from the front door of the facility,
opened a countless number of doors, descended an exhausting number of stairs, and trekked through what seemed like miles of hallways. In the end
I arrived in what I have come to call 'The Chamber of Truths'. It was there, in that chamber, that I stumbled upon a lifechanging event. I had 
walked into a room that seemed to have no end, one side was set up similar to a hangar, with rows upon rows of ships unlike any I had ever seen,
on the other side was a series of stereotypical test tubes, with vague humanoid shadows cast upon their opaque glass. I walked up to the first tube
and stared into it, mystified, wondering what could possibly be inside. So I did the only logical thing that anyone could do at that moment, I pressed
every button, pulled every lever, and flipped every switch I could find, hoping to see, to satisfy my curiosity. Suddenly, the glass on the tube
receded and a normal looking human male fell out. The man looked at me, and before he collapsed, said "They will come for us now, we must escape".
Hurriedly I picked him up and looked around for a means to leave, I quickly came to the realization that I could never find my way back through the
maze that led me here. I looked across the room as an insane thought came to me, which, given my current situation was saying something. I was going
to steal a ship. Without even thinking through the details of whether or not it was actually possible to do so, I carried him over to the nearest
ship, it was singlehandedly the most generic looking space ship I had ever seen, like a futuristic looking jet that had stolen its design from the
Galaga ship, minus the rockets. As I approached, a walkway descended from underneath, it seemed to know what it was I wanted to do, because as I 
walked up the ramp I could feel it lift off the ground and start to spin. By the time I had gotten up to the cockpit area it was facing the wall
on the far side of the runway, I placed the man into one of the seats and sat in the other. I had no idea what I was doing but that didn't seem
to matter, because the next thing I knew the wall had opened up, revealing a slanted shaft, and the ship had started to speed towards it. The 
last thing I remember from that day was seeing the traces of daybreak from the top of the shaft, feeling the ship start accelerating at an
insane rate, the visible world around me seemingly melting away, and then, nothing.  




Nobody took it seriously. 

At times, I wish they would have. Maybe then I wouldn't be in this mess.
